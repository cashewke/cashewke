0,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"Their pizzas are amazing. Everything from the pizza bread, the sauce and cheese is amazeballs!! I could go everyday and never get tired of eating here. They have a cute blue van that people can eat in. I never have because of my arthritis. They have a shop that has awesome things to give as gifts or keep For yourself.  They also have a spot for a band, we've never gone at those times. Their parking can get congested at peak hours as everyone loves to eat here! So come early, or park next door. But I'd suggest going for an early dinner or a nice long lunch.

Oh! Also, they are cash only. They have an ATM, I don't remember how much it costs to take money out, but that part goes to a charity.  Welcome to Gainesville! Have a great time.",0.276,0.035,0.689,Positive
1,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"""Disneyland for hippies"".  

But yeah, they have vegan pizza and tempeh toppings, reasonably priced so I'm not mad at it.  
Ask for the vegan personal pizza, off menu special.  It's the size and price of two large slices ($8 + 50c topping, load it up!) and I could barely eat all of it!  Pretty good crust depending on how long it's been in the oven, it's *perfect* almost NY style it's it's fully cooked/a like extra crusty.  I've had it a little underdone too.

Lightning salvage music venue in back is similarly hoky, like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Get good and high before you go, and the bizzarro folk art everywhere will be a fun experience.

Staff is a little off.  Not enough to ruin your meal though.  They play good music sometimes, especially in the back.  My favorite seating is the little alley of booths on the side of the building, if you go with friends it feels private even with other people in there.  

Also they have good soda.",0.298,0.05,0.652,Positive
2,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"I don't look to go to Satchel's very often, as I am really not a fan of their pizza, but it is close to my work place, so it happens from time to time.

This time around it was for lunch, so I went for the lunch special of a salad and a slice of pizza, plus an extra slice because I was feeling hungry. One slice of jalapeno, the other with pineapple. Frankly, I should have just gone for the single slice with two toppings, because I was stuffed afterwards.

The salads are quite good, I will happily admit. The pizza? Meh. Really, not a fan of this style of pizza and how they make it. However, the place is a definite college town kind of place, which is odd given how far away from UF it actually is. I would expect to find a place like this across the street from the university, not nearly three miles as the crow flies (which with Gainesville traffic equates to a 20 minute drive).",0.257,0.035,0.708,Positive
3,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"Pizza was delicious. Definitely worth a visit while we were in town. The dough was so good and the crust was perfect.

We enjoyed sitting outside in the nice weather. We also ordered a flight of soda to try. My favorite was the ginger ale. Also loved the story sheet that came with the flight!

Service was fast and friendly. We went next door to the little shop afterwards and looked around. Also took a peek in the garden area. Really enjoyed our experience here and will return next time we are in Gainesville.",0.458,0.0,0.542,Positive
4,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"When in Gainesville, you HAVE to visit this place!  This is an artsy,  super quirky and uniquely decorated pizza joint! You can eat in a van or even a plane- yep. You heard me!  We started off with a fun handcrafted soda flight, followed by their famous salad, ending with the Satch pan pizza which was phenomenal! The dough was thick, fluffy and soft... the best texture. Slices were huge!  You definitely have to try this spot if you're in the area. We were lucky as we didn't have to wait at all! We were seated immediately on a Friday evening around 6:00 pm.",0.318,0.0,0.682,Positive

6,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"Top shelf ZA: bar none.   After 50 years of eating pizza this one makes my  all time top 20 globally....and that is a lot of pizza!    A very tasty offering of local craft beer  as well as large volume producers.   A nice selection of toppings and lots of choices for both meat and veg heads.   Their salad is also a standout in both use of real greens and nuts and NOT a lame mess  of iceberg lettuce and shredded carrots.    The house dressing is definitely worth taking home.   A nice interpretation of a balsamic blend kudos!

We had the  veg deep dish with black olives, onions, g-peppers, jalapeños, veg sausage & garlic....2 of us could only eat half.   Reheated luxury will begin tonight as it is even better the next day!

Mind you the variety of flavors does not start or stop with the food.   The folks there we OTT kind and gracious plus the eclectic style makes the 5th star possible for me.   It is a complete experience you will both remember and return to as often as your wasteline will allow....daily if you focus on the salad!
Thanks to Tory and Savannah!",0.239,0.069,0.692,Positive

8,Satchel's Pizza,4.5 star rating,"We really wanted to go somewhere that would accommodate groups, and I instantly thought of Satchel's Pizza! I had gone here before a few years ago, but after a while we were ready to return. Instantly, the atmosphere was great, it felt really home-y and cozy!

We had a group of around 13 people, so the wait was a little while, but nothing too crazy. It seemed to fly by with the attractions and live music on the Friday night. Our group ordered various types of pizza, and they were absolutely delicious. I loved the fact that it's freshly made, and there were so many varieties that catered to our group's dietary restrictions.

Great food with a great environment--highly recommend if you decide to drop by Gainesville!",0.334,0.026,0.64,Positive

10,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"If I were put on the spot to choose a place to eat, my first choice would be Bolay. This is the place that not only hits your tastebud's needs, but also gives you all the nutritional options that your body needs.

I always go with the Sweet Potato Noodles base, basically a savory clear noodle option, but it doesn't taste like sweet potatoes. The vegetable options always vary but I'd recommended the potatoes, Brussels sprouts, zucchini, or corn! I always go with the bbq chicken or teriyaki chicken option but you can't go wrong with any protein.

I love the sauces that come with each bowl, and I'd recommend trying all of them to see which fits your taste buds. The white creamy sauce is also vegan! 10/10 would recommend trying and coming here regularly!!",0.2,0.048,0.752,Positive
11,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"Hip hip BOLAY!

Pictured is a fresh bowl with a base of kale salad and jasmine rice, topped with teriyaki chicken, lemon chicken, beans, roasted red potatoes, and fresh cilantro.

Try this with a side of their pesto sauce; it's remarkable!

For the rating of 4/5, this location just did not have their highly anticipated Asian sweet potato noodles at the time. Next time, I sure hope they do!",0.316,0.0,0.684,Positive
12,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"I've had Bolay before but this time I went ""all out"" for dinner. I ordered a large bowl with steak, potato noodles, kale salad, Brussel sprouts, corn and avocado. The steak and avocado was an upcharge along with the extra shrimp I ordered. Also bought a Hawaiian healer drink and a water. As always the food was fresh and delicious. I was really surprised at how refreshing the Hawaiian drink was, it was a combination of pineapple and ginger. I walked away with a full stomach and even had leftovers to take home. Lastly, the service is also polite and attentive. I'm always satisfied eating Bolay and this specific establishment seems to offer quality on every level.",0.145,0.0,0.855,Positive
13,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"When I went to Bolay the other times, I was disappointed. After reading my review, Dan and Matthew- both the managers- personally reached out to me and gave me a complimentary bowl. I appreciated this a lot and they fixed the problems that I had addressed in my previous review. I love a restaurant that actually listens to the voiced concerns on their customers. I had never tried the cookies but let me tell you- the snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies are so SO great!! I will continue being a regular for their fresh and delicious food!",0.349,0.093,0.558,Positive
14,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"After hearing lots of good things about this lace I finally got a chance to check them out.

When I arrived I was taken back by how busy they were which to me is a great sign that the food is good. I enter to find a bright, clean well-organized dining area. I really loved the color palette here.

It took me a moment to get the layout of the place but it was an easy process. You simply head down to the counter where you place your order. YOu can choose from house-made bowls or choose to build your own.

I went with a build your own. I was able to choose my base from sweet potatoes noodles to rice to spinach. Then you get 2 vegetable options I went with mushrooms and Tuscan Zucchini. Last you choose a protein I went with Terkayi chicken but you can choose bbq chicken, lemon pepper, mojo pork or tofu, and even shrimp. Of meat is not your thing you can add an extra veggie.

The final stop was dressing as well as cheese and cilantro.

I have to say this place is amazing. The food is fresh, great-tasting, and is much healthier than in some places. Plus serve was quick and friendly. Everyone was super sweet and so helpful.

I was really loving the flavors here with grilled vegetables, roasted vegetables, tender flavorful meat. t was a nice change for the taste buds.

Also, the price is reasonable and portions are the perfect size to keep you full and fueled.",0.346,0.013,0.641,Positive
15,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"Wow. Just wow. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place! I went at lunch time and got a small bowl, which was PLENTY of food and let me tell you - ya girl can EAT. I'm stuffed!!

I opted for the build your own bowl option: Sweet potato noodles, teriyaki chicken, broccoli, potatoes. Everything was incredible. I got their garlic sauce on the side as well. They have fountain drinks, but I'd highly recommend doling out the ~$4 for a fresh pressed juice. The strawberry orange was insanely refreshing on this hot day.

There's plenty of seating both inside and outside. The staff are really nice and will offer suggestions and their favorites in case you've never been there and need some help. They also have pre-set bowl options to choose from. I will be back (like really soon).",0.258,0.022,0.72,Positive
16,Bolay,4.5 star rating,"The delicious aromas that hit you when you walk in reassure you you've made a good choice!

20,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"Quite literally my favorite restaurant in Gainesville. My mom from Houston said it's one of the most authentic Mexican inspired places she's ever been to outside of Texas. Almost always a good sign when cops and construction workers are at a spot for lunch cause they know the best spots. You are likely to see just that at La Tienda. The burritos are my favorite for their amazing value, but no one that I've gone with has ever been disappointed with any of the menu items.",0.354,0.049,0.597,Positive
21,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"It has been a number of years since I wrote about La Tienda, and now seems as good a time as any.

I get food from La Tienda on a regular basis, and it is always excellent to have. The menu hasn't really changed much over the years, though the prices do appear to have gone up lately. Totally expected, and it is still inexpensive!

The ordering system is still the same... counter service but they bring the food out to your table after finding the numbered placard. Chips are not free, but the salsa and the queso are excellent. I always love getting steak and cheese quesadillas. The tacos are also quite good.

One of the easiest ways to tell that this is the premier place in town to get decent Mexican food is to look at the clientele. The prices are low, and the folks that buy the food know it is good.",0.284,0.021,0.694,Positive
22,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"A staple in Gainesville, La Tienda offers the most authentic Mexican food in Gainesville. My go to is their el pastor chimichanga which is a fried burrito stuffed with pineapple and pork topped with avocado and queso. My friend and I also got chips which were fresh and still warm from the fryer. If you're feeling adventurous you can try lingua or beef tongue which my friend loves. This place would be five stars for me however understandably since Covid the prices have increased pretty significantly which has made me go less frequently than before.",0.343,0.0,0.657,Positive
23,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"This spot in Gainesville is one of my favorites to go to when in town. It fits any budget being very wallet friendly but also doesn't sacrifice on taste. Known as la tienda or the shop, this restaurant is located on 13th street just a couple blocks away from UF campus. It has everything you need to do grocery shopping and also have a meal. The menu is very extensive and has any option you would desire from a Mexican place. My favorite and always go to is the chicken fajitas. A plate piled high with chicken, peppers, and onions served with tortillas, refried beans, mexican rice and avocado is always a yes for me. I implore to give this place a try in the area. Also they play soccer matches on the occasion.",0.206,0.023,0.771,Positive

25,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"Incredibly happy with their Birria tacos - Seriously, BIG YUM.  

La Tienda Latina on 13th street in Gainesville, locally established and serving authentic Mexican food for so long I almost forget to visit more often. Great prices, conveniently quick counter service, and friendly staff. Been eating here 10+ times in my life. Plenty of outdoor seating, definitely worth a stop if you're in Gainesville!

On their Facebook post (not on the menu), I saw that they were making birria tacos, and I had to try! Wow - I am so glad I did!!!  They are delicious. I would go back for this dish.

On a side note, the Store section in the back seems to have a good stock of unique things, just a bit dark.",0.312,0.059,0.629,Positive
26,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"Whenever you are up in the Gainesville area and want a taste of authentic Mexican food try La Tienda Cantina. Located on S.W. 13th Street, you can recognize it by the large sign visible from the street and the red and green trim of the building. La Tienda offers outdoor seating as well as inside dining.

The inside isn't fancy but it is clean and colorful with artwork and paintings on the tables. It's the kind of place where you can relax, have great food and a beer. It's also family friendly and has a nice selection of kid's meals. There isn't any table service here - you go to the counter and order your food. When your food is ready, they call your number and you go up to the counter again and get your plate. Like I said a relaxed, casual Cantina.

I have never been disappointed with the food whenever we go. La Tienda offers the free chips and salsa plus they have two different kinds of homemade hot sauce for free to go with your meal. Both spicy, one hotter than the other but equally delicious. L I alternate between the two depending on how spicy I want my food.

My meal was Camarones a la Diablo and a side of guacamole along with my plate. Their Platos Fuertes which means dinner plates come with the entree and refried beans and Mexican rice. My dish consisted of shrimp cooked in a spicy red sauce served with refried beans and rice. I didn't feel like having refried beans that day so they were kind enough to give me a double portion of rice. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce while spicy was not overly hot on the spice scale and had a really good flavor. It was the first time I ordered this particular meal and loved it so much whenever I get the chance again to visit, I will definitely be ordering it. Guacamole was spot on and a treat with their homemade tortilla chips. Generous portions are served so if you go home hungry - it's definitely your fault. Unsweetened ice tea rounded out my meal so refresh that I had several refills.

Staff is very friendly and are bilingual but to make your ordering easier they number their menu items. They did have hand sanitizers at various spots in the restaurant and followed the social distancing recommendations.

An excellent meal that my entire family enjoyed even the little ones. I hope you give this family run Cantina a try!",0.325,0.024,0.652,Positive
27,La Tienda Latina,4 star rating,"Second time here. When in Gainesville, this local favorite should definitely be on your list to try. People arrive in the parking lot before they even open. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options too.

The market component is fairly small and mostly comprised of some personal care/hygiene type items and plenty of souvenirs and country specific lanyard, keychains, etc. (Guatemala, Venezuela, and more).

Ordering is easy and done directly at the counter. After paying, they'll give you a number to take to your seat for matching you to the correct order when it comes out.

We opted for tacos, a side of rice and refried beans, and a chicken burrito. The burrito was gigantic and literally bursting at the seems with chicken, beans, and rice. The tacos were excellent too - I'm a big fan of both the al pastor and chorizo tacos here.

The menu is quite large and there are a ton of options to please just about anyone. We'll certainly stop in again the next time we're passing through.",0.195,0.021,0.784,Positive

I regret spending my money on this food as I couldn't even eat it properly. I got chicken tacos, and I had to pull all the chicken off as it's so chewy, flavorless and dry I can't even chew or swallow it. the chips and queso is the best thing i've tried from here but still average. the past 2 times i've been here the chicken is not chewable, and the meal is expensive compared to other mexican restaurants . there is better mexican places in gainesville especially if you're looking for tacos.",0.101,0.076,0.823,Positive

32,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"This remains the best Japanese restaurant in Gainesville after 20+ years. The food and drink is consistently amazing. No matter what you order, or what your dietary restrictions are, you will receive a delicious meal. After years of enjoying wagu & tuna, I went vegan 5 years ago and was delighted to find their vegan options were just as tasty! They have a 7 piece vegan offering that blows my mind every time I have the pleasure of ordering it. The maitake mushroom fritter is also a must have. Finally, the warm spinach salad is so simple yet satisfying!  

The wait can be painful, but I guarantee it is more than worth it!",0.396,0.036,0.569,Positive
33,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"Thee elite Sushi bar in the swamp!!

We've been blessed with so many delicious sushi spots in Gainesville and Dragonfly is definitely right up at the top. Don't think that you can just pop up here all the time, a reservation would be a wise choice! Located in the heart of downtown Gainesville, Dragonfly is a fantastic choice for a friend's night out, date night, or whatever occasion you're celebrating.

You're in for a real treat whether you sit and enjoy your dinner al fresca with a view of the city or if you sit inside in the beautifully-decorated interior restaurant. The vibes inside of the restaurant are so moody and chill, I love it!

I honestly feel like there hasn't been a dish that I have failed to enjoy here, from the entrees to the sushi bar - each bite has been worthwhile. The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and when paired with one of their delicious cocktails? *chefs kiss*  

I've  also always enjoyed the amazing service I've received here and my last visit was no exception. Upon learning that we were celebrating a birthday and major life changes, our amazing server returned to our table with a surprise plate of mochi ice cream, fruit and chocolate - so sweet!!

35,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"My uncle and cousin told me this was the best sushi they've ever had. They even said a random couple in Greece heard the name Gainesville and immediately raved about Dragonfly. From folks who have traveled all over the world, including Japan, that was hard to believe. But after a fantastic dinner, I think I have to concede.

First off, sake mojitos?? Never heard of it before, but I'm glad this delicious concoction has been added to my repertoire.

The lightly fired ahi tuna appetizer was to die for! Wrapped up in little seaweed packages, the fish just dissolved in your mouth. It's covered in this delicious fried furikake-type seasoning that I could eat by the spoonful (and the waiter said some do).

I had a hard time choosing which rolls to try. They don't have any traditional rolls, but their own interesting twist on everything. Both the Black Dragon and the Dragon Fly roll were incredible!! They were filled with soft-shell crab and eel (which I can never get enough of, and don't always get together). The Black Dragon had an almost BBQ like kick to it. The Dragon Fly was probably my favorite.

We also tried the O-Renji, was was very refreshing and light compared to the others. It was topped with orange, and the fish really shone through with the citrus.

The waitstaff was super friendly, and the place was bustling like bonkers. 100% returning every time I'm in Gainesville.",0.19,0.095,0.715,Positive
36,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"My favorite ""treat yourself sushi"" in town! Is it cheap? No. Is it authentic? No. But does it taste delicious and will I continue to come? YES!!  I'd recommend coming close to opening or making a reservation because it does get busy on the weekends and is a popular spot during graduation season.

I think my favorite roll so far is the Smoky Dragon! I really like the Volcano, Black Dragon, and Cobra Kai rolls too. An interesting roll they have is the Mango Tango, and definitely has a unique taste if you're worried about ordering multiple rolls and having the flavors start to all blend together. If you're one of those people who don't like fruits in their savory dishes then this is not for you... I also wouldn't really recommend the ""Spicy roll"" either because it is quite small and sad in comparison to the fancier rolls.

Their ramen is a solid choice too!

I really need to try more rolls! I'm constantly trying to find excuses and reasons to celebrate so that I can make a trip to Dragonfly haha.",0.288,0.077,0.635,Positive
37,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"Dragonfly is worth every single wait, bite, and penny. The waitress was so kind- even helping me find a non-alcoholic mocktail to order. I loved the experience of ordering in between rounds and ordering until we were full. The fish is so fresh we could not believe it and ended up ordering more!
The only note I would give is that the sashimi we ordered was cut unevenly. But it was a busy night so I understood. There is an option for everyone here. You must go to Dragonfly!!",0.264,0.041,0.695,Positive
38,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"So you can get in the ""queue"" online. It gave us a wait of 52 minutes. No issues as it's an online queue. Directions said show up 10 minutes prior to the time that would be 10 minutes. When we showed up we were told we would be waiting another 45 minutes. So it is obviously apparent the online queue is complete BS. When they texted us to come back we were seated at the Sushi bar not even a table. It is completely unbelievable to me that this place gets anywhere near the business it does being over priced and service is this bad.

So now my girlfriend is basically done eating and my entry hasn't shown up... Getting better.

For the record, the wait staff and kitchen runner have been great. Just seems like the business process is broken as f",0.129,0.073,0.798,Positive
39,Dragonfly Sushi and Sake,4 star rating,"4/15/21: After a long day of driving yesterday, my boyfriend and decided to rest. Then later go out to dinner.

Me, being a sushi lover, I decided to ""Yelp for Help"" hehe
I read the reviews of few Yelpers,  they seemed pleased about this place so then I let my boyfriend know.
Of course, my boyfriend was like, ""You and your Yelp""  LOL... he just jelly, he is not a Yelp Elite :p

ANYWAYS.... My boyfriend and I decided to take an Uber to the place! Even the Uber driver said, ""Dragonfly is amazing!""-- hearing that from the Uber driver, made me more excited :)

Once we arrived. we noticed that the place offers outdoor seatings as well as indoor seatings. [Oh!] the place was pack. However, it did not stop us :)
We went inside and was greeted by the host and the hostess. They told us, ""it would be a 40min wait.""  We responded back, ""that's ok, because it will give us time to look around downtown"" Then the host asked for my name and number. The number was used so the host can text me when a table is available.

[Long story short] Downtown in Gainesville was not bad at all! So many other restaurants to check out... They even had few wall art to look at :)

Fast forward time: The host kept his word about the waiting time :)
We were seated in a nice corner. I enjoyed it because I was able to admire a beautiful view outside as the sun goes down :)

Our waitress, Carol greeted us while serving us water. She was so sweet and polite ! I let her know that there would be two checks; meaning, I would take care of the food and my bf takes care of the drinks (it is never like this all the time, we take turns in paying always). :)

We ordered:
Pork Ramen - $14
--- pork belly, bok choy, bean sprouts,
poached egg, mayu, negi, beni shoga, menma, nori, tonkotsu broth, scallions
Volcano Roll. - $14
--- baked, salmon, bacon, pickled jalapeños, scallop delight, avocado, krab delight, spicy sauce, eel sauce
Mango Tango - $ 11
--- smoked salmon, cream cheese, mango, avocado, tempura flakes, sweet potato curls, peach-apricot reduction
Mango Mochi - $11

Drink:
Wakatake Onikoroshi 'Demon Slayer' - $95
- shizuoka prefecture
junmai daiginjo
--- very clean, beautifully round, silky texture, hints of honeydew

Main reason why my boyfriend got the 'DemonSlayer' was because that's our favorite anime tv show we watched and he loves high quality drinks haha :))

Overall thought, I enjoyed everything!!!! Ramen was cooked just right, Sushi(s) were fresh and delightful. Loved the Mango Mochi!

--- Service, Experience, & Food 10/10 :)

I can't wait to come here whenever I am in town again!

[Oh!] they have a vegetarian menu! :)

Check out the menu! -- Very easy to navigate too!

Even though Metro Diner is a chain, it embodies the essence of local hometown. When we arrived, there was plenty of tables available so we opted to sit outside and enjoy the morning. Our server came over to our table, took our drink order while we perused the menu. The patio was a popular option for people and was filling up quickly with hungry people. A couple sets of customers had their dog with them which added a level of fun. The dogs were super well behaved and the younger crowd enjoyed visiting with them. Our server came back, refilled out drinks,  and took our order.

In no time flat, our breakfast was being brought out to our table. The breakfasts we ordered looked ready for a photo shoot but more importantly were very tasty. There was plenty to eat also as the meals included plenty of food. I ordered the Bissell Breakfast with came with two eggs to order, your choice of meat, hash browns or grits, and a short stack of pancakes. I opted for over medium, sausage patties, and hash browns. Everything was hot and tasty! Exactly what was needed to fuel us for the day.

If you have read my reviews, you will know I am a firm believer in local and supporting local businesses. Even though the Metro Diner isn't really ""local"", it has the feeling of it and that qualifies in my opinion. If you are in the Gainesville Florida area, check out Metro Diner. They do more than breakfast and if breakfast is any indication, everything else will be good also! Finally, the staff is awesome!  Helpful, friendly, and genuinely glad you are there.",0.228,0.022,0.75,Positive
43,Metro Diner,4.5 star rating,"Good drive away from home, but nevertheless the wife and I decided to get takeout from Metro once again. Wasn't disappointed!

Ordered a Swiss mushroom burger (medium) with onion rings, and fish and chips, with sides including slaw, mac 'n cheese, and mashed potatoes with gravy.

Despite my bad decision to order close to lunchtime, on a Friday, I Road Warrior'd my way through fairly heavy traffic, got our food, and arrived home.

Burger was perfectly cooked. The fish and chips were solid, but I'm afraid the Haile Bistro at present outdoes them for both the size of their fish serving and its flavor. Step up!

Slaw was decent, with regular and red cabbage and not an overwhelming amount of mayo-based dressing. Mashed potatoes were clearly homemade and not flakes, and the chef appears to raise the bar a notch and season the gravy with cumin on top of extra sage, perhaps Latino influence? Only hitch was the mac 'n cheese, decent, but really needed more cheese.

It comes with different sides that can be customized to your order! The chicken and waffles are also really good. The chicken is especially crispy and it goes super well with the hot and spicy syrup that they give you. The strawberry butter puts a nice aromatic twist to the waffles. When put all together, this dish is extremely tasty.",0.392,0.0,0.608,Positive
45,Metro Diner,4.5 star rating,"Metro Diner is a chain. They seem to be everywhere, even in my neck of the woods in South Florida. Well, until they weren't, and somehow despite wanting to go there, I never made it as the locations near me all closed.

Upon realization that I was driving up north, I made a stop at my old stomping grounds. Go Gators!

Anyway, let's talk food.

I really expected something else entirely. Everyone I know minus one person who is extremely picky with food absolutely adores this place. I consider myself difficult to impress, usually finding most restaurants average, but this place managed to underwhelm me, and so, I'm inclined to agree with the aforementioned picky person.

I stopped there around noon and sat at the bar. The staff was very friendly and you could tell there were plenty of locals present. Good start, I thought. Waitress came around, very smiley, and of course helpful. Chose to order off the lunch menu rather than the brunch menu. Maybe this was my mistake?

Ordered some tea as I wanted to avoid coffee. This was pretty standard. Awaited my entree, a beautiful-looking pot pie that ensnared the senses with its smell alone. Then I happened to take a bite and it was a sheer disappointment.

This isn't to say the pie was bad, it just wasn't good. It was bland. So bland that I don't think dousing it in salt and pepper would've helped. It killed what little appetite I had and instead I took to my tea, sipping away. When the tea is the best part of a meal, you have a problem.

Moreover, this chicken pot pie got me thinking mine tasted better. That's saying something, too, as I'm no chef and I generally hate cooking. But eh, this chicken pot pie just didn't cut it. I ended up taking it to go as I felt bad leaving it there, but I didn't bother eating the leftovers. Instead I made my own chicken pot pie a few days later and my craving for this entree was sated. Needless to say, I won't be going out of my way for Metro Diner.",0.158,0.14,0.702,Positive

I have been two times, one time I ordered the fruit topping waffle and the other a classic egg, bacon and hash brown breakfast. Both orders were exactly what you'd want from a local diner. Hearty ingredients, cooked to perfection and generous portions.

I recommend Metro Diner to anyone that needs a quick fuel up! There is outdoor seating available, booths inside with covid plastic separators and a counter for people dining solo.

We were greeted immediately and the waiter took the order and brought us water.  As time went on the patio started filling up.  Then came the ""Are you almost done "" texts from my son.  I looked around and noticed that everyone who came in after us was eating.  It was 40 minutes since we ordered!  It doesn't take that long to scramble eggs.  

We were just about to walk out when the food finally arrived.  The food was good, not worth the wait.  I'm sure they just lost the order in the kitchen.

48,Metro Diner,4.5 star rating,"I've never had chicken and waffles before and was looking forward to this before we leave the south. I feel like it's sort of a rite of passage thing! Today was the day!

Our server was funny. He made the spicy maple syrup mix for us, following *very precise* recipe XD... It was good, I like the kick! The fried chicken was amazing- crispy skin, tender meat and very flavorful. It was too salty for my husband's taste but good for me. I must say that I'm not a big fan of sweet chicken, so if I had a choice, I'd just use hot sauce and not maple syrup (I feel like I might have said something sinful just now...)

The strawberry butter was very good, but I didn't have it in me to use the whole thing. I felt like I needed an cardiac angiogram after this meal, but hey, now I can say I've had chicken and waffles!

About the seating, it was very crowded. Tables were somewhat close together. Clear dividers were used between different parties, but it was a little awkward trying not to look at the strangers next to you.

My first biscuit was the Sticky Maple. The biscuits were huge and soft. The warmth of the biscuit went well with the maple syrup. The chicken breast was bigger than the biscuit and crispy. I so happy to add the pecan smoked bacon for extra flavor. I love bacon dipped in syrup!
The second sandwich was The Farmer. The biscuit and chicken breast was very good along with the bacon, but instead of maple syrup this was topped with fresh house-made apple butter.

One thing I loved was the fact that you could build your own pizza and add as many toppings as you pleased with no additional charge.

As you walk in you are greeted by what looks like a sald bar but is actually the pizza bar with all the fresh toppings. They have pre-designed pizzas or you can design your own. I started with a traditional cheese pizza and a order of pesto garlic bread.

The pesto garlic bread is baked and the cheese is melted on to a nice texture with pockets of golden brown pieces. The pesto sauce is drizzled on to provide that robust flavor with a hint of garlic.

Now the pizza. A thin crust wood fired pizza. Everything is measured out to provide a standard flavor for each piece. The sauce has a little flavor that does not overpower the cheese and we all know the cheese is what makes a pizza, lol.

I called the store to ask if I could order over the phone instead, but I was rudely told by a female employee that ""it's too busy-- we don't do that on the weekends.""

I've worked in busy restaurants before and I would not even consider saying that to a customer, no matter how busy it is. I understand high volume situations and having longer wait times. That I can handle. But refusing to take a simple order is not a great way to keep customers.

BIG. MISTAKE. The restaurant was empty except for a handful of tables, but our party of 2 had to wait 10 minutes before being seated, as did the party of 2 behind us. We were brought out a few items (salad, kimchi, onions, macaroni salad of some sort, etc.) but were not told what any of it was. We opted for the all you can eat Q option for $29/person. We immediately found out they were out of corn cheese, which is one of the main reasons I opted to try this out over hot pot...

No one gave us any instructions on how to use the grill. We got beef fat to oil the grill, but weren't shown what to do with it. It stopped ""oiling"" the grill after the first set of grilled meats and we had no idea how to turn our grill temp down. We didn't receive drinks until after our first food order. We didn't receive the sides we asked for until we asked for them again with the second round of food. We tried 6 or 7 kinds of meats and the cuts were awful. The thin pork belly had hard shards in it that made me think I was about to crack a tooth. The marinaded meats had little to no flavor and no sauces aside from yum yum or two spicy sauces were available. I was shocked. This restaurant is severely understaffed and no one came around to check in on us, we were constantly having to flag someone down for drink refills, etc. We left without eating many of the awful cuts of meat that we were given, and no one even bothered to ask us how it was or why we didn't touch it.

This was or was really darn close to being the worst meal I've ever had in my 10 years of living in this city AND it cost over $70. It's sad because my fiancé said it used to be good, but it is definitely not anymore...",0.103,0.129,0.768,Negative
93,Beque Holic,4 star rating,"I've been going to bequeholic for a few years and it still remains a very strong kbbq pick after all the changes it has gone through. I would say the quality has gone down, but I do think it was to pass savings onto the customer especially during high inflationary times. The standard pork belly and brisket still is great, but the salad, sides, and sauces seemed to have been experimented with to save on costs. Still will be a great experience and the best (and only) kbbq option in Gainesville",0.326,0.0,0.674,Positive
94,Beque Holic,4 star rating,"Through traveling back home from the holidays my husband and I wanted some Korean BBQ (one of our favorite foods and we stop and try everyone we can)
Beque did NOT disappoint!
The restaurant is very charming and dimly lit, which gave it a very intimate feel to an all you can eat place. Very romantic and great for a date night!
The sides it came with we fantastic and many I had never had though I frequent Korean bbq often.
The meat were perfectly sized portions and very fresh!
So many options again I'm not used to seeing, like Korean fried chicken! Omg I LOVE Korean fried chicken!
The service was spectacular and our waiter was so attentive and gave wonderful advise.
The soju was served in the cutest glasses I've ever seen! And the mango soju just blew me away!

Thanks you Beque for a wonderful experience and we cannot wait til next year to stop in again",0.389,0.058,0.553,Positive
95,Beque Holic,4 star rating,You can't go wrong here. Also Sam is the BEST server I have ever had. I have gotten him twice in the past few months and he is always super attentive and genuine. Trevor's playlist sucks though. Please stop giving him the aux.,0.404,0.118,0.478,Positive
96,Beque Holic,4 star rating,This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I just had a very bad experience last time I went here. We were waiting for a waiter to stop by and take order for 20 min and we're ignored multiple times. The waiter who was supposed to serve us ignored us at least twice and spent the most time at our neighboring table. He was totally flirting with the two girls at that table and didn't even serve anyone else. We were so angry and decided to leave while still hungry. We ended up paying an overall $145 for a party of three but left unsatisfied. I will never go back to this place again while I'm in Gainesville.,0.101,0.226,0.673,Negative
97,Beque Holic,4 star rating,"I've been twice. Once a few years ago and once recently. I will say that the menu has changed a little bit. The ""Q"" all you can eat option is definitely the way to go especially if you want to be a little bit more adventurous. I have seen others comment on the quality of meat is not what are used to be but unless you're eating this every single day or you go to Korean BBQ style places often, I think the quality of meat was really better than you'd get from a lot of other places.

We also tried some Soju cocktails and they were delicious.

If you're looking for a fun place to sit around with friends and have an experience while eating different kinds of meats and grilling your own food, then this is definitely a great option!",0.296,0.0,0.704,Positive
98,Beque Holic,4 star rating,"Great quality of meat, great soup, rice, and my favorite salad ever.... however, I used to come here like twice a week with my gf. I'd give it 5 stars, but they got rid of the sweet soy sauce and their old hot sauce that came with oil and salt. Went a couple times without their sauces, but honestly won't be going back for a while. The reason they got rid of their sauce doesn't make sense, either. A sweet soy sauce is a staple at any restaurant like this. The Yum Yum sauce is decent, but it's pretty bland.",0.31,0.03,0.66,Positive
99,Beque Holic,4 star rating,"This place really grew on me over the years. My husband and I would come weekly, sometimes more. Is was fun and so good. HOWEVER, just this last week they, for some reason, switched out their grills. These new ones are HORRIBLE!! We thought it was just the one at our table and asked to be moved but it didn't help. These new grills make everything taste like propane. It's all you could taste! Completely ruined the experience and taste. We usually come here for a fun date night but this time we left $80 poorer, hungry, and disappointed. From what our waiter said, we aren't the only ones to think this. I don't know why they changed the grills, there was no need to. Unless they change back, they've lost our business.",0.137,0.203,0.661,Negative
